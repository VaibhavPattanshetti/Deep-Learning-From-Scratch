# Deep Learning From Scratch

This repository contains my hands-on implementations while studying deep learning.

The focus is on understanding core concepts by implementing them from scratch or with minimal use of frameworks.  
The code evolves as my learning progresses.

## Structure
Each folder represents a concept, experiment, or model explored during the learning process.

## Note
These are educational implementations intended for learning and experimentation, not production-ready projects.
